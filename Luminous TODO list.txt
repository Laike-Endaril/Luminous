Figure out how to inject my code correctly, either by finding a way to inject sooner, or by post-injection
Currently, 2 of the 3 classes are already loaded before even FLib gets referenced at all

Improve efficiency
Fix moving light objects (don't work as well as the raw moving light test in Luminous class)
Improve mod compat (maybe ASM instead of full class replacement)



BUILD NOTE:
If any changes are made to replaced classes, build once, grab class files for them from jar, and put them in assets, then build again
