Get obfuscated ASM for all 3 classes and try applying it and testing



Need to get obfuscated edited classes into the transformer somehow...
* Auto-generate asm code to create obfuscated class? (attempting)
* Write class visitors?
* See if an obfuscated bytestream works?



Improve efficiency
Fix moving light objects (don't work as well as the raw moving light test in Luminous class)
Improve mod compat (maybe ASM instead of full class replacement)



BUILD NOTE:
If any changes are made to replaced classes, build once, grab class files for them from jar, and put them in assets, then build again
