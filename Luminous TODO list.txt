Improve efficiency
Fix moving light objects (don't work as well as the raw moving light test in Luminous class)
Improve mod compat (maybe ASM instead of full class replacement)

Sky light does not seem to propagate or render, though it does set the source block's server-side value correctly (detected by DS light gauge)
Note: sky light doesn't burn zombies if they can't "see the sky".  This is just normal behavior
